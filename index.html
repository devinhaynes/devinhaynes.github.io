  <p><strong>D</strong>orian Grayson Senior was born to this world on September 4, 2017 at 9:30 a.m. At three weeks early, he weighed only 6 lbs 7 oz with a height of 18 and 1/2 in. He came out with a full head of hair and a good set of lungs. There were no complications at birth and the doctors did a fine job at getting him out quickly. But of course all the credit needs to go to Mommy for all her hard work and dedication during the pregnancy.</p>
