    <h1 id="name">Dorian Grayson Senior</h1>
      <p><strong>D</strong>orian Grayson Senior was born to this world on September 4, 2017 at 9:40 a.m. At three weeks early, he weighed only 6 lbs 7 oz with a height of 18 and 1/2 in. He came out with a full head of hair and a good set of lungs. There were no complications at birth and the doctors did a fine job at getting him out quickly. This website is dedicated to Dorain and all of the family and friends who wish to view his life story. This will be a living website that will be updated as Dorian continues to grow and develop.
      As of now, he is two months old and still in good health. He seems to look more like me(daddy) everyday. lol.  We are still trying to figure out his eye color, as it shifts from brown to green. Thank you for visiting. I hope you enjoy!
